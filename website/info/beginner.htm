<br>
<u><span style='font-size:15.0pt;color:yellow'>Character Statistics</span></u><br>
There are many statistics that determine your performance in battle they are:<br>
- Health Points (HP): This is how much life you have. If your HP goes to zero you 
will become wounded and unable to fight unless revived. 
If all characters are wounded its game over.<br>
- Ether Points (EP): Certain abilities cost EP. Once you run out you will not
be able to use those abilities until you restore it.<br>
- Level (LV): Each level requires a certain amount of experience points. When
you increase your level your statistics increase and you may also learn new
abilities.<br>
- Experience Points (XP): The number on the left is your current amount of
experience points. The number on right is how many you need to get to the next
level. You earn XP by winning battles.<br>
- Attack Power (Attk): Directly affects the amount of damage you do with
physical attacks.<br>
- Armor Class (AC): Directly affects how much damage you receive from physical
attacks.<br>
- Ether (ETH): Affects how much damage you cause by using magical abilities.
Also affects how much damage you receive from them.<br>
- Dexterity (DEX): The person with the highest dexterity is likely to go first
in battle. Dexterity also affects your chances of landing a hit and your chances of
running away.<br>
- Ability Points (AP): These can be used to learn certain abilities from the
skills menu. Everytime you win a battle you will recieve some AP.<br>
<br>
<u><span style='font-size:15.0pt;color:yellow'>Services (Shops, Inns, Churches)</span></u><br>
Many people offer special services for Gelda, the common currency around the
world. <br>
Shops:<br>
You will come across many different shops and merchants they allow you to buy
and sell items. If you try to sell an item, merchants will only give you half
the value of the item. Merchants sell General Goods, Tools, Spell Scrolls,
Weapons, and Armor.<br>
Inn/Hotel:<br>
Resting at an inn usually costs a small fee, after resting your party will be
fully restored; you are also given the option to save your game. Some abilities
are only restored after resting.<br>
Church:<br>
Later in the game there will be enemies that can drain experience points. If
this happens your characters face icon in the menu will turn gray. You can
visit a church and ask the priest to cast Greater Restoration on you for a
price. This will bring back lost experience and levels.<br>
<br>
<u><span style='font-size:15.0pt;color:yellow'>Weapons</span></u><br>
Equipping powerful weapons and armor makes you deadlier in combat. Some
enchanted pieces of equipment grant you special abilities or protections. Some
heavier weapons can weigh you down, lowering dexterity. There are many
different kinds of weapons, in the beginning of their description you will see
a 1H or a 2H. When using a 2H weapon you may not use a shield. There are also 4
different kinds of damage they can cause (Slashing, Blunt, Piercing, Missile);
some enemies are weak against these types. Their respected letter is found
right after the 1H or 2H. <br>
There are many different kinds of weapons:<br>
-Dagger (Piercing): Small and very quick, daggers usually do a smaller amount
of damage but they do increase your dexterity.<br>
-Sword (Slashing): Swords offer a balance in power, durability, and weight.
Some swords are 2handed and can be very powerful but heavy.<br>
-Mace (Blunt): Blunted weapons that can cause a lot of damage. They are
the preferred weapons of clerics.<br>
-Stave (Blunt): These are 2-handed weapons. Some of them are specifically
designed for combat, while others have been enchanted and increase Ether power.
Staves are usually weaker the other 2-handed weapons but they provide better
Armor Class.<br>
-Axe (Slashing): Powerful, slow, and deadly, some axes are 1 handed, others are 2
handed.<br>
-Lance (Piercing): Although not as powerful as most 2 handed weapons, they are
quicker.<br>
-Halberd (Slashing): A large bladed staff. Halberd's are some of the most
powerful 2-handed weapons.<br>
-Wakazaishi (Slashing): Preferred weapon of the ninja. These swords are quick
and light, perfect for a stealthy assassination.<br>
-Katana (Slashing): Good Katana's are very rare and powerful. Not only do they 
require great skill to make, but also great skill to wield properly.
Only fighters and Samurai can use them. <br>
-Gun (Missile): Newest technology in weaponry. Some of them are small and
others are big and devastating. Guns are very accurate and can do a good 
ammount of damge. Some guns hit the enemy twice.
The only downside is that you cannot parry an attack with a gun.
Equiping a gun gives a -1 penalty to ac.<br>
-Relic (????): These kinds of weapons are said to come from an ancient
civilization. Many of them are too advanced to be reproduced. Relics can
be extremely powerful. <br>
<br>
<u><span style='font-size:15.0pt;color:yellow'>Armor</span></u><br>
Armor increases your defensive capabilities. Some pieces also grant special
immunities and protections. There are 4 types of armor.<br>
-Shield: Shields are useful for added protection in battle. you cannot use one
if you have a 2 handed weapon equipped. Some characters use a weapon in each
hand and they cannot use shields either.<br>
-Body Armor: Protection for the main parts of the body. There are 3 different
kinds of Body Armor.<br>
---Robes: Lightest piece of armor. These are favored by mages because robes allow
them to move easily and cast their seplls. Some robes have magical properties.<br>
---Leather: Provides decent protection and is still lightweight, favored by
rogues.<br>
---Chain and Plate mail: Armor made of metal links and plate metal.
Heaviest and provides the highest protection.<br>
-Headgear: protection for the head, there are 2 kinds:<br>
---Hats: lightweight but offers smaller amounts of protection<br>
---Helmets: Protects most areas of the head and face. Ideal for fighters<br>
-Other: Each character can wear one accessory. They can do anything from
raising your stats to granting special abilities and immunities.<br>
<br>
<u><span style='font-size:15.0pt;color:yellow'>Conversing with NPC's</span></u><br>
NPC stands for Non-player character. There are people everywhere and some of
them may have important information. Talk to everyone you meet.<br>
