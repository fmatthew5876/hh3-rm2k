<span style='color:white'>Operation R was started by Governor Wilhelm and King Lenin. It is a covert operation 
staged in Timon to spy on the enemy and steal technology. Commander Fleet heads the operation in Timon and 
directs his agents. Some duties of an Agent of Operation R include spying, espionage, Assassinations, hacking, 
and Bombing. As an agent the most important rule is the code of silence. Operation R must maintain its secrecy 
at all times. Sharing any information about the Operation to anyone can result in being courtmarshalled and
arrested. Members of operation R include Agents from Kandirk and Ivory.<span><br>

information on their group. What we do know is that they are somehow tied to the Eastland Republic.<span><br>
