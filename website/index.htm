	    <td>This Game takes place in a time period similar 
		to the early 1900's late 1800's. One man has built 
		a great futuristic city in one night and he has 
		declared war on the world, promising to take everyone
		to see god. You are Lieutenant Ayen Karparl. You must 
		work with the spy organization in his city and
		find out what his plans are and steal his 
		technology. Along the way you discover an age-old prophecy
		that is about to come to life once again. Will Ayen be caught 
		up in this endless cycle of violence? Or will he try to 
		change the world after discovering the truth?
